# Set Up an App Dev Environment on Google Cloud: Challenge Lab

## Challenge scenario

You are just starting your junior cloud engineer role with Jooli inc. So far you have been helping teams create and manage Google Cloud resources.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don’t expect step-by-step guides.

## Your challenge

You are asked to help a newly formed development team with some of their initial work on a new project around storing and organizing photographs, called Memories. You have been asked to assist the Memories team with initial configuration for their application development environment.

You receive the following request to complete the following tasks:

* Create a bucket for storing the photographs.
* Create a Pub/Sub topic that will be used by a Cloud Run Function you create.
* Create a Cloud Run Function.
* Remove the previous cloud engineer’s access from the memories project.

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

* Create all resources in the **`REGION`** region and **`ZONE`** zone, unless otherwise directed.
* Use the project VPCs.
* Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**
* Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, use **e2-micro** for small Linux VMs and **e2-medium** for Windows or other applications such as Kubernetes nodes.

Each task is described in detail below, good luck!

## Task 1. Create a bucket

You need to create a bucket called **`qwiklabs-gcp-01-109be211d5dd-bucket`** for the storage of the photographs. Ensure the resource is created in the **`us-west1`** region and **`us-west1-a`** zone.

### Solution Task 1:

1. Create bucket: `gsutil mb -l us-west1 gs://qwiklabs-gcp-01-109be211d5dd-bucket`

## Task 2. Create a Pub/Sub topic

Create a Pub/Sub topic called **`topic-memories-899`** for the Cloud Run Function to send messages.

### Solution Task 2:

1. Create topic: `gcloud pubsub topics create topic-memories-899`

## Task 3. Create the thumbnail Cloud Run Function

Create a Cloud Run Function **`memories-thumbnail-maker`** that will to create a thumbnail from an image added to the **`qwiklabs-gcp-01-109be211d5dd-bucket`** bucket. Ensure the Cloud Run Function is using the **Cloud Run function** environment (which is 2nd generation). Ensure the resource is created in the **`us-west1`** region and **`us-west1-a`** zone.

1. Create a Cloud Run Function called **`memories-thumbnail-maker`**

**Note:** The Cloud Run Function is required to executes every time an object is created in the bucket created in Task 1. During the process Cloud Run Function may request permission to enable APIs. Please enable each of the required APIs as requested.

2. Make sure you set the Entry point (Function to execute) to **`memories-thumbnail-maker`** and Trigger to Cloud Storage.

3. Add the following code to the index.js:

```js
const functions = require("@google-cloud/functions-framework");
const crc32 = require("fast-crc32c");
const { Storage } = require("@google-cloud/storage");
const gcs = new Storage();
const { PubSub } = require("@google-cloud/pubsub");
const imagemagick = require("imagemagick-stream");

functions.cloudEvent("", (cloudEvent) => {
  const event = cloudEvent.data;

  console.log(`Event: ${event}`);
  console.log(`Hello ${event.bucket}`);

  const fileName = event.name;
  const bucketName = event.bucket;
  const size = "64x64";
  const bucket = gcs.bucket(bucketName);
  const topicName = "";
  const pubsub = new PubSub();
  if (fileName.search("64x64_thumbnail") == -1) {
    // doesn't have a thumbnail, get the filename extension
    var filename_split = fileName.split(".");
    var filename_ext = filename_split[filename_split.length - 1];
    var filename_without_ext = fileName.substring(
      0,
      fileName.length - filename_ext.length
    );
    if (
      filename_ext.toLowerCase() == "png" ||
      filename_ext.toLowerCase() == "jpg"
    ) {
      // only support png and jpg at this point
      console.log(`Processing Original: gs://${bucketName}/${fileName}`);
      const gcsObject = bucket.file(fileName);
      let newFilename =
        filename_without_ext + size + "_thumbnail." + filename_ext;
      let gcsNewObject = bucket.file(newFilename);
      let srcStream = gcsObject.createReadStream();
      let dstStream = gcsNewObject.createWriteStream();
      let resize = imagemagick().resize(size).quality(90);
      srcStream.pipe(resize).pipe(dstStream);
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        dstStream
          .on("error", (err) => {
            console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
            reject(err);
          })
          .on("finish", () => {
            console.log(`Success: ${fileName} → ${newFilename}`);
            // set the content-type
            gcsNewObject.setMetadata(
              {
                contentType: "image/" + filename_ext.toLowerCase(),
              },
              function (err, apiResponse) {}
            );
            pubsub
              .topic(topicName)
              .publisher()
              .publish(Buffer.from(newFilename))
              .then((messageId) => {
                console.log(`Message ${messageId} published.`);
              })
              .catch((err) => {
                console.error("ERROR:", err);
              });
          });
      });
    } else {
      console.log(
        `gs://${bucketName}/${fileName} is not an image I can handle`
      );
    }
  } else {
    console.log(`gs://${bucketName}/${fileName} already has a thumbnail`);
  }
});
```

4. Add the following code to the package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "thumbnails",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Create Thumbnail of uploaded image",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@google-cloud/functions-framework": "^3.0.0",
    "@google-cloud/pubsub": "^2.0.0",
    "@google-cloud/storage": "^5.0.0",
    "fast-crc32c": "1.0.4",
    "imagemagick-stream": "4.1.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {},
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=4.3.2"
  }
}
```

Verify the thumbnail was successfully created.

**Note:** If you get a permission denied error stating it may take a few minutes before all necessary permissions are propagated to the Service Agent, wait a few minutes and try again. Ensure you have the relevant roles (Eventarc Service Agent, Eventarc Event Receiver, Service Account Token Creator, and Pub/Sub Publisher) assigned to the correct service accounts.

### Solution Task 3:

Create the function with the console, like the tutorial.

## Task 4. Test the Infrastructure

You must upload one JPG or PNG image into the bucket

1. Upload a PNG or JPG image to **`qwiklabs-gcp-01-109be211d5dd-bucket`** bucket.

**Note:** Alternatively Download this image https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/gsp315/map.jpg to your machine. Then upload it to the bucket.

2. You will see a thumbnail image appear shortly afterwards (use REFRESH in the bucket details).

### Solution Task 4:

1. Download an image:

```yaml
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-training/gsp315/map.jpg --output map.jpg
```

2. Upload image in the bucket: `gsutil cp map.jpg gs://qwiklabs-gcp-01-109be211d5dd-bucket`

## Task 5. Remove the previous cloud engineer

You will see that there are two users defined in the project.

- One is your account (**`student-01-1cd5666dfdcd@qwiklabs.net`** 1 with the role of Owner).
- The other is the previous cloud engineer (**`student-02-cc5d24cc0c58@qwiklabs.net`** with the role of Viewer).

1. Remove the previous cloud engineer’s access from the project.

### Solution Task 5:

1. Go to IAM & Admin, search the previous cloud engineer **`student-02-cc5d24cc0c58@qwiklabs.net`**

2. Click on the pencil and erase the role of viewer

3. Save changes
