# Build a Secure Google Cloud Network: Challenge Lab

## Challenge scenario

You are a security consultant brought in by Jeff, who owns a small local company, to help him with his very successful website (juiceshop). Jeff is new to Google Cloud and had his neighbour's son set up the initial site. The neighbour's son has since had to leave for college, but before leaving, he made sure the site was running.

Below is the current set up:

## Your challenge

You need to configure this simple environment securely. Your first challenge is to set up appropriate firewall rules and virtual machine tags. You also need to ensure that SSH is only available to the bastion via IAP.

For the firewall rules, make sure:

- The bastion host does not have a public IP address.
- You can only SSH to the bastion and only via IAP.
- You can only SSH to juice-shop via the bastion.
- Only HTTP is open to the world for `juice-shop`.

Tips and tricks:

- Pay close attention to the network tags and the associated VPC firewall rules.
- Be specific and limit the size of the VPC firewall rule source ranges.
- Overly permissive permissions will not be marked correct.

## Task 1. Check the firewall rules. Remove the overly permissive rules.

### Solution Task 1:

* Go to **VPC network** > **Firewall** > will see **open-access**
* Use the following command from the cloud console:

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access
```

## Task 2. Navigate to Compute Engine in the Cloud console and identify the bastion host. The instance should be stopped. Start the instance.

### Solution Task 2:

* Go to **Compute Engine**  > **VM Instances** > Select **bastion** > click on **Start**

## Task 3. The bastion host is the one machine authorized to receive external SSH traffic. Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service. The firewall rule must be enabled for the bastion host instance using a network tag of **`grant-ssh-iap-ingress-ql-320`**.

### Solution Task 3:

* Run the following:
* Make sure you replace <SSH IAP network tag> with the tag provided on the Left Pane.
* make sure replace the correct zone to the instance.

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create grant-ssh-iap-ingress-ql-320 --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags grant-ssh-iap-ingress-ql-320 --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=grant-ssh-iap-ingress-ql-320 --zone=us-east4-a
```

## Task 4. The juice-shop server serves HTTP traffic. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address. The firewall rule must be enabled for the juice-shop instance using a network tag of **`grant-http-ingress-ql-320`**.

### Solution Task 4:

* Run the following:
* Make sure you replace <HTTP network tag> with the tag provided on the Left Pane.
* make sure replace the correct zone to the instance.

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create grant-http-ingress-ql-320 --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags grant-http-ingress-ql-320 --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=grant-http-ingress-ql-320 --zone=us-east4-a
```

## Task 5. You need to connect to juice-shop from the bastion using SSH. Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address. The firewall rule must be enabled for the juice-shop instance using a network tag of **`grant-ssh-internal-ingress-ql-320`**.

### Solution Task 5:

* Run the following:
* Make sure you replace <SSH internal network tag> with the tag provided on the Left Pane.
* make sure replace the correct zone to the instance.

```yaml
gcloud compute firewall-rules create grant-ssh-internal-ingress-ql-320 --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags grant-ssh-internal-ingress-ql-320 --network acme-vpc

gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=grant-ssh-internal-ingress-ql-320 --zone=us-east4-a
```

## Task 6. In the Compute Engine instances page, click the SSH button for the bastion host. Once connected, SSH to juice-shop.

### Solution Task 6:

* Go to **Compute Engine** > **VM instances** > **SSH** to **bastion** host
* Run the following:

```yaml
ssh <internal IP of the juice-shop>
```
